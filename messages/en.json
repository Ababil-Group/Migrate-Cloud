    "ans2": "The process typically takes a minimum of three months. This  timeframe includes a two-week period for obtaining a work permit, followed by at least six weeks for visa processing.",
    "faq3": "What happens if we are not satisfied with an employee?",
    "ans3": "If an employee does not meet your expectations, you have the right to terminate their contract as per standard employment  regulations. In such cases, we assist the worker in securing alternative employment. If no suitable opportunities arise, we facilitate their return to their home country.",
    "faq4": "Can we apply for work permits longer than 1 year?",
    "ans4": " Work permits are generally issued for one year, while seasonal  workers can obtain permits for up to six months. Due to bureaucratic procedures, securing a work permit and visa typically takes between two to three months.",
    "faq5": "How can work permits be renewed?",
    "ans5": " Renewal applications must be submitted at least one month before  the permit expires. The process requires the employee’s passport, previous ID card, recent photographs (for the new ID),  a statement from the accommodation provider, and a company-issued declaration confirming continued accommodation at the designated location.",
    "faq6": "Are there restrictions on hiring foreign workers?",
    "ans6": "Certain professions in Europe are classified as high-demand,  allowing employers to apply for work permits without undergoing  a labor market test. The official list of these professions is available through the relevant authorities. For positions not included in the shortage occupation list, a Labor Market Test is required. This process lasts for two weeks and assesses the availability of local workers. If a labor shortage is confirmed, applications for foreign workers can proceed accordingly."

      "queation1": "What Are Our Responsibilities in the Mediation Process?",
      "ans1": "The duties of agencies involved in foreign worker employment mediation include: – Identifying a suitable worker based on the client’s criteria, conducting the selection process, and providing the required documentation. – Preparing and submitting all necessary documentation to obtain temporary residence and work permits for third-country nationals. – Covering the costs of travel insurance for the workers. – Arranging the visa for residence and work in Europe. – Covering the cost of the worker's airfare.",
      "queation2": "What Are Your Responsibilities Towards a Foreign Worker?",
      "ans2": "Once a work permit is obtained for a foreign worker, accommodation and meals must be provided upon their arrival. Accommodation should meet basic living standards. If meals cannot be provided, a food allowance must be given. Additionally, it is mandatory to register the worker for pension and health insurance, just like any local employee.",
      "queation3": "  What Conditions Must Be Met to Obtain a Residence and Work Permit?",
      "ans3": "To obtain the necessary permits, the following conditions must be met: – Your business must be registered in Europe. – You must employ at least one-quarter of local citizens compared to third-country nationals on a full-time, indefinite basis for the past six months. – A certificate from the Tax Administration confirming no outstanding debts due to public benefits, dated within a recent period before applying for the permits. – There must be no legal convictions related to labor relations or social security.",
      "queation4": "Can the Worker Start Immediately?",
      "ans4": "Unfortunately, no. Since these workers are from third countries, they must first obtain a work permit and visa before entering Europe. The entire process can take anywhere from 45 to 90 days, depending on the speed of the involved institutions (CES, MUP, and MFA). Document preparation and negotiations typically take 4 to 10 days, depending on the employer’s readiness. Recruitment and candidate selection can range from 1 to 30 days (up to 7 days for low-skilled workers, up to 30 days for skilled workers), or longer if specific professions are required (up to 60 days). The labor market test (for professions with no shortage) typically lasts 15 days. Obtaining a work permit usually takes between 15 to 30 days, depending on the police station. Visa processing takes an additional 15 to 30 days, depending on the embassy. Organizing travel and the worker’s arrival in Europe generally takes 1 to 10 days."
